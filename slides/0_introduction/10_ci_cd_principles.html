    Встроенное качество/Build-in Quality
    Create short feedback loops to deal with bugs as soon as they are created.
    By having issues looped back to developers as soon as they fail post-build test, it will enable them to produce higher quality code quicker.
    In addition, fewer issues will be found later on in the process, when it will be more expensive to fix.

    Ответственность/Everyone is Responsible
    In high performing organizations, nothing is “somebody else’s problem.”
    Developers are responsible for the quality and stability of the software they build.
    Operations teams are responsible for helping developers build quality in.
    Everyone works together to achieve the organizational level goals, rather than optimizing for what’s best for their team or department.

    Все в виде кода/Version Control Everything
    Code, configuration, scripts, databases, documentation. Everything!
    Having one source of truth – and a reliable one – gives you a stable foundation to build your processes upon.

    Автоматизация/Automate Everything
    Automate your builds, your testing, your releases, your configuration changes and everything else.
    Manual processes are inherently less repeatable, more prone to error and less efficient.
    Once you automate a process, less effort is needed to run it and monitor its progress – and it will ensure you get consistent results.

    Совершенствование/Continuous Improvement
    Continuous improvement, or kaizen in Japanese, is another key idea from the Lean movement. Taiichi Ohno, a key figure in the history of the Toyota company, once said,

        Kaizen opportunitites are infinite. Don’t think you have made things better than before and be at ease…
        This would be like the student who becomes proud because they bested their master two times out of three in fencing.
        Once you pick up the sprouts of kaizen ideas, it is important to have the attitude in our daily work that just underneath one kaizen idea is yet another one.

    Don’t treat transformation as a project to be embarked on and then completed so we can return to business as usual.
    The best organizations are those where everybody treats improvement work as an essential part of their daily work, and where nobody is satisfied with the status quo.
